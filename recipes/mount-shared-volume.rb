# Cookbook Name:: hanadb
# Recipe:: mount-shared-volume
# Mount the shared volume for HANA distributed installs 

# first a check is done, if the directory of the nfs share is
# exported from the given nfs server. note: it is only checked,
# if it is exported at all, but not if to a certain machine,
# so the mount might still fail (raising an exception in that
# case). the reason for this check is to guarantee proper order
# of installations, i.e. workers only after the nfs server is
# active and not to have a bulletproof mount.
